# solitarica_trainer
I wanted to learn how cheat trainers work in .net so I started with an easy game which is Solitarica, a fun roguelike card game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/463980/Solitairica/
![Game Image](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F5BAwkk4RPp0%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)
The game runs in x64 for me so i had to use the memorydll64 package rather than the usual x86, so modify the source code if you'd rather use x86.
